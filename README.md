# Location Simulator


## How to run the application
**Step 1:** Update the ```DIRECTION_API_KEY``` variable in ```application.properties``` with your own API key.

**Step 2:** Run the application

For Mac:
```
./gradlew bootRun
```
For Windows:
```
gradlew.bat bootRun
```

## Demo
Latitute and Longitude of Sikar: 12.93175,77.62872

Latitude and Longitude of Jaipur: 12.92662,77.63696

Once the application is running, we can visit the URL ```http://localhost:8080/getpath/from/27.6094,75.1398/to/26.9124,75.7873/step/50``` and it will give the coordinates of points between Sikar and Jaipur separated by 50m.

### API response

The repository contains python code that can draw the path using the coordinates generated by API.
Run the application using command
```
gradlew.bat bootRun | awk -F'Coordinate:' '/Coordinate:/{print $2}'
```

and put the output in ```points.csv``` file.

After that run
```
python main.py
```
and it will plot the graph using the points.
