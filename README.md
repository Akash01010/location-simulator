# Location Simulator


## How to run the application
**Step 1:** Update the ```DIRECTION_API_KEY``` variable in ```application.properties``` with your own API key.

**Step 2:** Run the application

For Mac:
```
./gradlew bootRun
```
For Windows:
```
gradlew.bat bootRun
```

**Note:** The application uses Java version 16.

## Demo
Latitute and Longitude of Sikar: 27.6094,75.1398

Latitude and Longitude of Jaipur: 26.9124,75.7873

Once the application is running, we can visit the URL ```http://localhost:8080/getpath/from/27.6094,75.1398/to/26.9124,75.7873/step/50``` and it will give the coordinates of points between Sikar and Jaipur separated by 50m.

### API response
![alt text](https://github.com/Akash01010/location-simulator/blob/master/api_response.JPG?raw=true)

The repository contains python code that can draw the path using the coordinates generated by API.
Run the application using command
```
gradlew.bat bootRun | awk -F'Coordinate:' '/Coordinate:/{print $2}'
```

and put the output in ```points.csv``` file.

After that run
```
python main.py
```
and it will plot the graph using the points.

## Op Info Endpoints

### Health
```
http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

### Swagger
Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Default Path for OpenAPI discriptions in json http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs/

To get in yaml format: http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs.yaml

### Seluth
Seluth generates applicationName, traceId, spanId for each request and add it to headers. It is also printed in logs as shown below
```
2021-10-02 16:03:58.010  INFO **[location-simulator,0640e579462f0792,0640e579462f0792]** 18688 --- [nio-8080-exec-6] c.s.l.controller.LocationController      : Inside Hello
```
These logs are stored in memory by Seluth and can be exported to Zipkin Server, ELK for further analysis.

### Zipkin
Zipkin is a distributed tracing system.

**Step 1:** To start the zipkin server, Run
```commandline
java -jar zipkin-server-2.23.4-exec.jar
```

Zipkin server will start on http://localhost:9411/

**Step 2:** Uncomment ```spring.zipkin.base-url``` in application.properties file.

**Step 3:** Comment line ```spring.zipkin.enabled = false``` in application.properties

After enabling zipkin all the log traces should be visible in zipkin server:

### Jacoco
To generate jacoco test report, we just need to add jacoco plugin and then run
```
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
```
The report should be available under ```build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html```

If we need reports to be added in different formats, We need to add below block in build.gradle file

```groovy
jacocoTestReport {
    dependsOn test
    reports {
        xml.required
        csv.required
        html.required
    }
}
```

We need to add below section for verifying the code coverage
```groovy
jacocoTestCoverageVerification {
    violationRules {
        rule {
            enabled = true
            limit {
                minimum = 0.80
            }
        }
    }
}
```
